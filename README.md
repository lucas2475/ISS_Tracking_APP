## Project Overview

The project utilize a modern technology stack to efficetly retrieve, store
and serve ISS trajectory data. At its core, the Flask web framework is used to develop a RESTful API, allowing users to query ISS state vector data through various endpoints. And to optimize performance, the project employs Redis, and in memory key
This project provides a RESTful API to retrieve and process the International Space Station (ISS) trajectory data from NASAâ€™s public dataset. The API enables users to access the latest position, velocity, and trajectory data of the ISS, compute its instantaneous and average speed, and determine its geographical location over the Earth in real time.

To ensure efficient data retrieval and storage, the project uses Redis, a high-performance, in-memory database that allows for quick access to ISS state vectors. This setup minimizes latency and optimizes API performance.

Additionally, the tool is containerized using Docker, making deployment seamless, portable, and scalable across different environments.


## File Descriptions

## Dataset information

This project utilizes the ISS Trajectory Data from NASA, which contains positional and velocity state vectors of the International Space Station (ISS). The data is provided in XML format and includes timestamps (EPOCH), Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z), and velocity components (X_DOT, Y_DOT, Z_DOT) in kilometers and kilometers per second. 

### Accessing the dataset 


To access the dataset, using the link https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/trajectory_data.cfm, the data is fected dynamically in the script.


### Data Format
The XML file consists of multiple <stateVector> elements, each representing a recorded timestamp (EPOCH) along with:

Position vectors (X, Y, Z) in km
Velocity vectors (X_DOT, Y_DOT, Z_DOT) in km/s

Example of a single entry in the XML file

```xml
<stateVector>
    <EPOCH>2025-04T12:00:00.000Z</EPOCH>
    <X units="km">-1636.12</X>
    <Y units="km">4106.75</Y>
    <Z units="km">-5162.71</Z>
    <X_DOT units="km/s">-7.42</X_DOT>
    <Y_DOT units="km/s">-1.09</Y_DOT>
    <Z_DOT units="km/s">-1.48</Z_DOT>
</stateVector>
```

## Content


- **`Dockerfile`**

    - The Dockerfile defines the containerized environment for running the python scripts. It:
        - Uses Python 3.9 as the base image
        - Sets up the working directory inside the container
        - Copies all Python scripts into the container
        - Installs necessary dependencies (e.g., pytest for unit testing)
        - Specifies python3 as the default command


- **`iss_tracker.py`**
  - read the ISS trajectory data from the NASA website
  - function to compute summary statistics including 
    - average speed of the ISS 
    - latest ISS data
    - range of ISS data 
    - geolocation of ISS
    - longitude, latitude, and altitude of the ISS
  


- **`test_iss_tracker.py`**

  - unit test for `iss_tracker.py`
    - verify the accuracy of the result


- **`docker-compose.yml`**
  - The docker-compose.yml file defines the multi-container setup for the ISS Tracker application. It specifies the services required for the application, including:
    - A Flask-based web server to provide API endpoints
    - A Redis database for storing ISS state vectors and efficiently reetrieving them 

  - Also, to ensure that Redis data persists across container restarts, we use a bind mount to store the database backup locally in the `./data/`directory. On startup, Redis loads the existing data from `./data/` if available. If it is empty, Flask fecthes the ISS trajectory data from NASA stores it in Redis. And Redis periodcally saves its dataset to `./data/` ensuring persistence. 




## **Run the Project**


**1. Ensure Docker & Docker Compose are installed**

**2. Create a data/ Directory in your Local Machine**

Before running the continer, create a persistent directory on your host machine to store Redis data 
```bash
mkdir -p data
```


**3. Run the Containerized Data Analysis**

run the following command to start your Flask and Redis containers
```bash
docker-compose up
```
This will:
- build and start the services defined in your docker-compose.yml file
- if it is the first time running, it will pull images, build the Flask ap, and start the container.

if you want to run it in the background, use:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**4. Check Running Containers**

To verify that containers is running using the command:
```bash
docker ps
```
you should see both Flask app and Redis containers listed

**5. Test API endpoint**

After verifying that the containers are running, use curl to access different API endpoints and retrieve ISS data.

**6. Stop the Containers**

If you want to stop the containers, using the command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
